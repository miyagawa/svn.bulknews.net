NAME
    Convert::Base32 - Encoding and decoding of base32 strings

SYNOPSIS
      use Convert::Base32;

      $encoded = encode_base32("\x3a\x27\x0f\x93");
      $decoded = decode_base32($encoded);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides functions to convert string from / to Base32
    encoding, specified in RACE internet-draft. The Base32 encoding is
    designed to encode non-ASCII characters in DNS-compatible host name
    parts.

    See http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-idn-race-03.txt for
    more details.

FUNCTIONS
    Following functions are provided; like "MIME::Base64", they are in
    @EXPORT array. See the Exporter manpage for details.

    encode_base32($str)
        Encode data by calling the encode_base32() function. This function
        takes a string to encode and returns the encoded base32 string.

    decode_base32($str)
        Decode a base32 string by calling the decode_base32() function. This
        function takes a string to decode and returns the decoded string.

        This function might throw the exceptions such as "Data contains
        non-base32 characters", "Length of data invalid" and "PADDING number
        of bits at the end of output buffer are not all zero".
