DESCRIPTION
    "htdiff" is a command line tool to find structured difference between
    two HTML::Template templates. It may be quite useful for checking before
    your co-working designer fixes up your bare-bone template into
    production ready design. What you should check is just run "htdiff"
    against your template and the final template to see any typos or losing
    in migration are there.

PREREQUISTICS
    *   HTML::Template 2.5

    *   Text::Diff 0.32
