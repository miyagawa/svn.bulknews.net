NAME
    Attribute::Unimplemented - mark unimplemented methods

SYNOPSIS
      package SomeClass;
      use Attribute::Unimplemented;

      sub wip : Unimpemented {
          # this block won't be executed
          my $self = shift;
          $self->foo;
          $self->bar;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Attribute::Unimplemented can be used to mark your methods as
    unimplemented one.

    With this attribute on, calls to those methods will generate warnings
    and the real code inside the method won't be executed. That is the only
    difference with Attribute::Deprecated.
