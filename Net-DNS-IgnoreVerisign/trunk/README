NAME
    Net::DNS::IgnoreVerisign - fix Net::DNS to ignore Verisign's SiteFinder
    service

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::DNS;
      use Net::DNS::IgnoreVerisign;

      my $res = Net::DNS::Resolver->new();
      my $ans = $res->search("domain-which-is-not-existent.com");

DESCRIPTION
    Net::DNS::IgnoreVerisign is a Net::DNS fixer to ignore Verisign
    Sitefinder stuff. This module globally overrides Net::DNS::Resolver's
    "query" method. So it's not a perfect solution, but it'd be enough for a
    usual Net::DNS users in perl API layer.
