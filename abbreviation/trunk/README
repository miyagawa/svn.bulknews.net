SYNOPSIS
      use abbreviation qw(Very::Long::ClassName::Here);
  
      my $obj = Very::Long::ClassName::Here->new;
      my $obj = V::L::CN::Here->new;        # same

DESCRIPTION
    Tired of typing long class name? use abbreviation for that.

TRICK AND CAVEAT
    Dynamic package name aliasing can be implemented via:

    *   symbol table aliasing. (import.pm)

    *   dynamic inheritance. (namespace.pm)

    Both has virtue and vice. Currently, abbreviation.pm takes the former.
    This may change in the future.
