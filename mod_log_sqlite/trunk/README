mod_log_sqlite - Apache logging module to sqlite

INSTALL:

You can install this module easily via apxs magic.

  % make
  # make install
  % make clean

CONFIGURATION (summary):

1. install sqlite from http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/
2. Add following lines to your httpd.conf

    LogSQLiteDBFile sqlite-logs/sqlite_log
    LogSQLiteAutoChown On 

CONFIGURATION (details):

First you should install sqlite module manually. See
http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/ for details.

Then you should initialize access_log database (from 0.05, this is
optional). Note that the database file and the directory should be
writable by httpd running user ("nobody" by default).

  # mkdir /usr/local/apache/sqlite-logs
  # chown nobody:nobody /usr/local/apache/sqlite-logs
  % sudo -u nobody sqlite /usr/local/apache/sqlite-logs/sqlite_log < create_table.sql

"create_table.sql" is bundled with this module. Note that this module
automatically creates log table if there's not one, from 0.05. You can
let this moule do chown() automatically, by adding directive:

  LogSQLiteAutoChown On

Finally, simply add the following line to your httpd.conf:

  LogSQLiteDBFile sqlite-logs/sqlite_log

Table name is "access_log" by default. You can change it via
"LogSQLiteTable" directive if you want to.

  LogSQLiteTable wwwlog

From 0.05, this module supports separate database files per
VirtualHosts, which means you can even do:

  <VirtualHost x.x.x.x>
  ServerName vh.example.com
  LogSQLiteDBFile /home/vh.example.com/logs/sqlite_log
  </VirtualHost>

That's all! Enjoy querying your access_log via VIEWs and/or sub-querys.
