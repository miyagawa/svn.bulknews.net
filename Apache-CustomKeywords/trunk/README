DESCRIPTION
    Apache::CustomKeywords is a customizable proxy/webapp to change your
    MSIE's Location box to your favourite toolbar!

    See http://www.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/keywords.html for what Custom
    Keywords means in Mozilla. This module enables Custom Keywords in MSIE.

    With "CustomKeyword" settings shown in the section on "SYNOPSIS", you
    type "cpan CustomKeywords" or "google blah blah" in your browser's
    Location: box, then you will be redirected to the page you wanna go to!

    Here's the way this handler works:

    *   Type "foo bar" in Location: box

    *   MSIE sends request to "auto.search.msn.com"

    *   Apache::CustomKeywords detects it and redirects browser to your
        favourite search engine.

CONFIGURATION
    There're two ways to let your browser use this module:

    As a proxy server
        configure "httpd.conf" with a proxy version and set up your
        browser's proxy setting.

    As a pseudo MSN
        configure "httpd.conf" with psuedo MSN version and set up your Hosts
        file ("/etc/hosts" in Un*x, "Windows/Hosts" or
        "windows/system/drivers/etc/Hosts" in Win32) or local DNS so that
        "auto.search.msn.com" points to the server where this module is
        installed.

NOTE
    If you put ":" or "@" as a query in Location: box, MSIE recognizes it as
    protocol or authentication password stuff, hence this module might not
    work.

TODO
    *   User-definable conversion of query paramers, including encoding
        conversions. Currenty only %s interpolates to URI-Escaped string
        encoded in UTF8.
