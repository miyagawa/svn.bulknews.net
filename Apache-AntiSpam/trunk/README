DESCRIPTION
    Apache::AntiSpam is a filter module to prevent e-mail addresses exposed
    as is on web pages. The way to hide addresses from spammers are
    implemented in each of Apache::Antispam::* subclasses.

    This module is Filter aware, meaning that it can work within
    Apache::Filter framework without modification.

SUBCLASSING
    Here is how to make your own filter.

    Declare your class
    Inherit from Apache::AntiSpam
    define antispamize() method
    That's all. Template of antispamize() method will be like this:

      sub antispamize {
          my($class, $email, $orig) = @_;
          # do some stuff..
          return $orig;
      }

    where "$class" is your class, "$email" is an instance of Mail::Address,
    and "$orig" is an original e-mail address string. See the Email::Find
    manpage for details.

TODO
    *   remove mailto: tags using HTML::Parser.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    The idea of this module is stolen from Apache::AddrMunge by Mark J
    Dominus. See http://perl.plover.com/AddrMunge/ for details.

    Many thanks to Michael G. Schwern for kindly improving the matching
    speed of Email::Find.
