NAME
    HTML::XSSLint - audit XSS vulnerability of web pages

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::XSSLint;

      my $agent   = HTML::XSSLint->new;

      # there may be multiple forms in a single HTML
      # if there's no from, @result is empty
      my @result  = $agent->audit($url);

      for my $result (grep { $_->vulnerable } @result) {
          my $action  = $result->action;
          my @names   = $result->names;
          my $example = $result->example;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    HTML::XSSLint is a subclass of LWP::UserAgent to audit Cross Site
    Scripting (XSS) vulnerability by generating random input against HTML
    forms in a web page.

    Note that the way this module works is not robust, so you can't say a
    web page is XSS free because it passes HTML::XSSLint audit.

    This module is a backend for command line utility "xsslint" bundled in
    the distribution. See the xsslint manpage for details.
