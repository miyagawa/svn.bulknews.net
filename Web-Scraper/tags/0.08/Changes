Revision history for Perl extension Web::Scraper

        - Call $tree->delete after the callback to avoid memory leaks by TreeBuilder.
          (Thanks to k.daiba for the report)

0.07  Sat May 12 16:23:51 PDT 2007
        - Updated dependencies for HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath

0.06  Sat May 12 15:47:27 PDT 2007
        - Now don't use decoded_content to work with new H::R::Encoding

0.05  Wed May  9 18:21:22 PDT 2007
        - Added (less DSL-ish) Web::Scraper->define(sub { ... }) syntax
        - Fixed bug where the module dies if there's no encoding found in HTTP response headers
        - Added more examples in eg/
        - When we get value using callback, pass HTML::Element object as $_, in addition to $_[0]
          (Suggested by Matt S. Trout)
        - If the expression (1st argument to process()) starts with "/", it's
          treated as a direct XPath and no Selector-to-XPath conversion is done.

        - *API CHANGE* Now scraper {} returns Web::Scraper object and not closure.
          You should call ->scrape() to get the response back.
          (Suggested by Marcus Ramberg)

          I loved the code returning closure, but this is more compatible to
          scrapi.rb API and hopefully less confusing to people.

        - use 'TEXT' rather than 'content' to grab text from element
          to be more compatible with scrapi
        - Added unit tests using Test::Base
        - Refactored internal code for easier reading
        - chained callbacks are now passed HTML::Element, not HTML, to avoid double HTML parsing
        - Implemented callbacks (iterator) API
        - Added 'process_first' to be compatible with scrapi
