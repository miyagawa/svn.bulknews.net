NAME
    Apache::ACEProxy - IDN compatible ACE proxy server

SYNOPSIS
      # in httpd.conf
      PerlTransHandler Apache::ACEProxy # default uses ::UTF8_RACE

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::ACEProxy is a mod_perl based HTTP proxy server, which handles
    internationalized domain names correctly. This module automaticaly
    detects IDNs in HTTP requests and converts them in ACE encoding. Host:
    headers in HTTP requests are also encoded in ACE.

    Set your browser's proxy setting to Apache::ACEProxy based server, and
    you can browse web-sites of multilingual domain names.

SUBCLASSING
    Default ACE conversion is done from UTF8 to RACE. Here's how you
    customize this.

    *   Declare your ACE encoder class (like DUDE, AMC-ACE-Z).

    *   Inherit from Apache::ACEProxy.

    *   Define "encode()" class method.

    That's all. Here's an example of implementation, extracted from
    Apache::ACEProxy::UTF8_RACE.

      package Apache::ACEProxy::UTF8_RACE;

      use base qw(Apache::ACEProxy);
      use Convert::RACE qw(to_race);
      use Unicode::String qw(utf8);

      sub encode {
          my($class, $domain) = @_;
          return to_race(utf8($domain)->utf16);
      }

    Note that you should define "encode()" method as a class method.
    Argument $domain is a (maybe UTF8) string that your browser sends to the
    proxy server.

    At last, remember to add the following line to httpd.conf or so:

      PerlTransHandler Apache::ACEProxy::UTF8_RACE

CAVEATS
    The default Apache::ACEProxy::UTF8_RACE assumes that input domain names
    are encoded in UTF8. But currently it's known that:

    *   MSIE's "always send URL as UTF8" preference does NOT ALWAYS send
        correct UTF8 string.

    *   Netscape 4.x does NOT send URL as UTF8, but in local encodings.

    So, this proxy server doesn't always work well with all the domains for
    all the browsers. If you figure out how your browser encodes
    multilingual domain names, you can write your custom translator as in
    the section on "SUBCLASSING". See also the Apache::ACEProxy::SJIS_RACE
    manpage if your mother language is Japanese.

    Suggestions, patches and reports are welcome about this issue.
