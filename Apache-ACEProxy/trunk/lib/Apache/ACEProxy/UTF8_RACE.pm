=head1 NAME

Apache::ACEProxy::UTF8_RACE - IDN compatible RACE proxy server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in httpd.conf
  PerlTransHandler Apache::ACEProxy::UTF8_RACE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Apache::ACEProxy::UTF8_RACE is one of the implementations of
Apache::ACEProxy. This module encodes UTF88 encoded domain names into
RACE encoding, specified in C<draft-ietf-idn-race-03.txt>.

RACE encoding is currently tested domain name encoding by some
regitrars. Note that this may (possibly, will) be changed if an ACE is
chosen as the standard. See http://www.i-d-n.net/ for the details.

=head1 CAVEATS

Works well only for browsers which sends URL as UTF8. See
L<Apache::ACEProxy/"CAVEATS"> for details.
