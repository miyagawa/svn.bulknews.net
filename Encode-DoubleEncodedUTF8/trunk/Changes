Revision history for Perl extension Encode::DoubleEncodedUTF8

  0.02  Wed Feb 14 14:46:04 PST 2007
        - Now the code to find dodgy utf-8 bytes is Encode.pm-free and all regexp based.
          Easy to port to other languages and I guess it's even faster.
          (Thanks to Dan Kogai and Mark Fowler for the regexps)
