NAME
    Geo::Coder::Google - Google Maps Geocoding API

SYNOPSIS
      use Geo::Coder::Google;

      my $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Google->new(apikey => 'Your API Key');
      my $location = $geocoder->geocode( location => 'Hollywood and Highland, Los Angeles, CA' );

DESCRIPTION
    Geo::Coder::Google provides a geocoding functionality using Google Maps
    API.

METHODS
    new
          $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Google->new(apikey => 'Your API Key');
          $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Google->new(apikey => 'Your API Key', host => 'maps.google.co.jp');

        Creates a new geocoding object. You should pass a valid Google Maps
        API Key as "apikey" parameter.

        When you'd like to query Japanese address, you might want to set
        *host* parameter, which should point to *maps.google.co.jp*. I think
        this also applies to other countries like UK (maps.google.co.uk),
        but so far I only tested with *.com* and *.co.jp*.

    geocode
          $location = $geocoder->geocode(location => $location);
          @location = $geocoder->geocode(location => $location);

        Queries *$location* to Google Maps geocoding API and returns hash
        refernece returned back from API server. When you cann the method in
        an array context, it returns all the candidates got back, while it
        returns the 1st one in a scalar context.

        When you'd like to pass non-ascii string as a location, you should
        pass it as either UTF-8 bytes or Unicode flagged string.

        Returned data structure is as follows:

          {
            'AddressDetails' => {
              'Country' => {
                'AdministrativeArea' => {
                  'SubAdministrativeArea' => {
                    'SubAdministrativeAreaName' => 'San Francisco',
                    'Locality' => {
                      'PostalCode' => {
                        'PostalCodeNumber' => '94107'
                      },
                      'LocalityName' => 'San Francisco',
                      'Thoroughfare' => {
                        'ThoroughfareName' => '548 4th St'
                      }
                    }
                  },
                  'AdministrativeAreaName' => 'CA'
                },
                'CountryNameCode' => 'US'
              }
            },
            'address' => '548 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA',
            'Point' => {
              'coordinates' => [
                '-122.397323',
                '37.778993',
                0
              ]
            }
          }
