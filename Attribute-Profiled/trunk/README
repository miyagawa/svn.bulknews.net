NAME
    Attribute::Profiled - Profiles specific methods in class

SYNOPSIS
      package SomeClass;
      use Attribute::Profiled;

      sub long_running_method : Profiled { }

DESCRIPTION
    Attribute::Profiled provides a way to profile specific methods with
    attributes. This module uses Benchmark::Timer to profile elapsed times
    for your calls to the methods with Profiled attribute on.

    Profiling report will be printed to STDERR at the end of program
    execution.

TODO
    *   Options where to print profiling report.

    *   Allows public way to get reports in any timing other than the end of
        execution. Currently you can do it by explicitly calling report() on
        $Attribute::Profiled::_Profiler.
