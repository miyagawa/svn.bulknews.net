NAME
    Apache::Profiler - profiles time seconds needed for every request

SYNOPSIS
      <Location /cgi-bin>
      PerlInitHandler Apache::Profiler
      </Location>

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::Profiler is a mod_perl init (and cleanup) handler to profile
    time taken to process one request. Profiled data is reported to the
    Apache Log file. It'd be useful to profile some heavy application taking
    a long time to proceed.

    It uses the Time::HiRes manpage to take milliseconds, and outputs
    profiled data as Apache log "notice" level like:

      [Tue Oct  7 20:52:53 2003] [notice] [client 127.0.0.1] uri: /test.html takes 0.0648910999298096 seconds

CONFIGURATION
    ProfileLongerThan
          PerlSetVar ProfileLongerThan 0.5

        specifies lower limit of request time taken to profile. This example
        only logs requests which takes longer than 0.5 seconds. This value
        is set to 0 by default, which means it logs all requests.

TODO
    *   customizable log format (exportable to some profiling tools)

    *   profiles CPU time rather than "gettimeofday"
