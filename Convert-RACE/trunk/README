NAME
    Convert::RACE - Conversion between Unicode and RACE

SYNOPSIS
      use Convert::RACE;

      $domain = to_race($utf16str);
      $utf16str = from_race($domain);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides functions to convert between RACE (Row-based ASCII-
    Compatible Encoding) and Unicode Encodings.

    RACE converts strings with internationalized characters into strings of
    US-ASCII that are acceptable as host name parts in current DNS host
    naming usage.

    See http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-idn-race-03.txt for
    more details.

FUNCTION
    Following functions are provided; they are all in @EXPORT array. See the
    Exporter manpage for details.

    to_race($utf16)
        to_race() takes UTF-16 encoding and returns RACE-encoded strings
        such as 'bq--aewrcsy'.

        This function throws an exception such as 'String includes no
        internationalized characters', 'String too long' and 'Invalid
        encoding to compress'. Exceptions are thrown with Carp::croak(), so
        you can cath 'em with eval {};

    from_race($domain_name)
        from_race() takes 'bq--' prefixed string and returns original UTF-16
        string.

        This function throws an exception such as 'String not begin with bq-
        -', 'Decoded string includes no internationalized characters' and '
        Invalid format to decompress'. Exceptions are thrown with
        Carp::croak(), so you can cath 'em with eval {};

    See the Unicode::String manpage, the Unicode::Map8 manpage, the Jcode
    manpage for Unicode conversions.

CLASS METHOD
    Following class methods are provided to change the behaviour of
    Convert::RACE.

    prefix_tag()
        Set and get the domain prefix tag. By default, 'bq--'.

EXAMPLES
      use Jcode;
      use Unicode::String 'latin1';
      use Convert::RACE 'to_race';

      # EUC-japanese here
      $name = to_race(Jcode->new('ÆüËÜ¸ì','euc')->ucs2);
      
      # or, Latin here
      $name = to_race(latin1($latin_string)->utf16);

      # in doubt of exception
      eval { $name = to_race($utf); };
      if ($@) { 
          warn "Can't encode to RACE: $@";
      }

      # change the prefix
      Convert::RACE->prefix_tag('xx--');
