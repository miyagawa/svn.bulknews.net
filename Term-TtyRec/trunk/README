NAME
    Term::TtyRec - handles ttyrec data

SYNOPSIS
      use Term::TtyRec;
      use FileHandle;

      # $handle is any IO::* object
      my $handle = FileHandle->new('file.tty');
      my $ttyrec = Term::TtyRec->new($handle);

      # iterates through datafile
      while (my($sec, $text) = $ttyrec->read_next) {
          do_some_stuff();
      }

DESCRIPTION
    What is ttyrec? Here is an excerpt.

      ttyrec is a tty recorder. Recorded data can be played back with the
      included ttyplay command. ttyrec is just a derivative of script
      command for recording timing information with microsecond accuracy
      as well. It can record emacs -nw, vi, lynx, or any programs running
      on tty.

    See http://www.namazu.org/~satoru/ttyrec/ for details.

    Term::TtyRec is a simple class for ttyrec recorded data. This module
    provides a way to itertate through recorded from any IO. See
    Term::TtyRec::Player for playing recorded data.

METHODS
    read_next
          ($sec, $text) = $ttyrec->read_next;

        iterates data inside and returns number of second, textdata. Returns
        empty list when it reaches end of data.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
    Almost all of its code are stolen from ruby-ttyplay.
