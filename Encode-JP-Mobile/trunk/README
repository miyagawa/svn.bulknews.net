NAME
    Encode::JP::Mobile - Shift_JIS variants of Japanese Mobile phones

SYNOPSIS
      use Encode::JP::Mobile;

      my $char   = "\x82\xb1\xf9\x5d\xf8\xa0\x82\xb1";
      my $string = decode("shift_jis-imode", $char);

DESCRIPTION
    Encode::JP::Mobile is an Encode module to support Shift_JIS variants
    used in Japaese mobile phone browsers.

    This module is EXPERIMENTAL. That means API and implementations will
    sometimge be backward incompatible.

ENCODINGS
    This module currently supports the following encodings.

    shift_jis-imode
        for DoCoMo pictograms. "shift_jis-docomo" is alias.

    shift_jis-vodafone
        for Vodafone pictograms. Since it uses escape sequence, decoding
        algorithm is not based on ucm file.

    shift_jis-kddi
        for KDDI/AU pictograms. "shift_jis-ezweb" is alias.

    shift_jis-airedge
        for AirEDGE pictograms. "shift_jis-airh" is alias.

NOTES
    *   ucm files are based on "cp932.ucm", not "shiftjis.ucm", since it
        looks more appropriate for possible use cases. I'm open for any
        suggesitions on this matter.

    *   Pictogram characters are defined to be round-trip safe. However,
        they use Unicode Private Area for such characters, that means you'll
        have interoperability issues, which this module doesn't try to
        solve.

TODO
    *   Support KDDI encodings for 7bit E-mail ("iso-2022-jp-kddi").

    *   Implement all merged "shift_jis-mobile-jp" encoding.
