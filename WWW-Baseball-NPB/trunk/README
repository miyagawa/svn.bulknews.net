DESCRIPTION
    WWW::Baseball::NPB provides you a way to fetch and extract Japanese
    baseball games information via Yahoo! Baseball. (NPB = Nippon
    Professional Baseball)

NOTE
    *   Characters like team names, status and stadium are encoded in
        EUC-JP. You can convert them to any encoding via Jcode.

TODO
    *   Separate out Yahoo! Baseball parsing logic, using information
        provider architecture (e.g. WWW::Baseball::NPB::Provider::*)
